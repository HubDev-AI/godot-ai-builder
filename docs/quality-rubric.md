# Game Quality Rubric

## Purpose

This rubric defines the minimum quality bar for games generated by Godot AI Builder.
Its intent is to prevent "tutorial-level" output and enforce games that are playable,
cohesive, and visually meaningful.

## Core Principle

A game is only considered complete when it passes:

1. Hard gates (binary pass/fail)
2. Weighted quality score
3. Visual and thematic coherence checks

Failing any of these means the build is not done.

## 1) Hard Gates (Must Pass)

### Stability

1. Zero script errors.
2. Zero critical warnings.
3. No startup or runtime crash in normal play session.

### Playability

1. Full flow works end-to-end:
   - menu -> gameplay -> win/lose -> restart/menu
2. Controls are responsive and explained in-game.
3. No soft-lock or dead-end in at least 10 minutes of play.

### Depth

1. Core loop is complete (goal, challenge, feedback, failure/success state).
2. Progression exists (difficulty scaling + upgrades or equivalent).
3. At least 3 clearly distinct enemy/obstacle behaviors.
4. At least 3 meaningful player choices that change playstyle.

### Presentation

1. Main entities (player, enemies, projectiles, pickups, UI) have intentional visuals.
2. HUD readability is acceptable at gameplay speed.
3. At least 5 active polish elements are visible in gameplay.

## 2) Visual Quality Gates (Anti-Tutorial Bar)

All visual gates must pass:

1. **Art Direction Pillar**
   - A named visual direction exists (e.g., "neon industrial decay").
2. **Palette Discipline**
   - Primary palette is limited and coherent; accent colors are intentional.
3. **Silhouette Readability**
   - Player, enemies, hazards are recognizable at a glance.
4. **Depth and Layering**
   - Background, midground, foreground and FX layers are deliberately composed.
5. **Feedback Clarity**
   - Hit, damage, death, pickup, and ability events each have distinct visual cues.
6. **UI Theme Consistency**
   - Menu/HUD style matches gameplay style (not a default-looking overlay).
7. **No Raw Placeholder Feel**
   - If placeholders are used, they are stylized and coherent, not random primitives.

## 3) Weighted Scoring (100 Points)

| Category | Weight | Minimum |
|---|---:|---:|
| Core Loop Clarity and Fun | 20 | 3/5 |
| Controls and Game Feel | 20 | 3/5 |
| Progression and Build Variety | 20 | 3/5 |
| Encounter and Content Depth | 15 | 3/5 |
| Visual Polish and Aesthetic Cohesion | 15 | 3/5 |
| UX (HUD, Menus, Onboarding, Feedback) | 10 | 3/5 |

### Scoring Rules

1. Total score must be >= 80.
2. No category may be below 3/5.
3. At least two categories must reach 4/5 or higher.
4. "Visual Polish and Aesthetic Cohesion" must be >= 4/5 for "very good" status.

## 4) "Very Good Game" Criteria

A generated game qualifies as "very good" only if:

1. All hard gates pass.
2. Total score >= 85.
3. Controls/Game Feel >= 4/5.
4. Progression/Variety >= 4/5.
5. Visual Polish/Aesthetic Cohesion >= 4/5.
6. At least two "signature moments" exist (memorable combat/event/presentation beats).

## 5) Mandatory Build Iteration Loop

For each build:

1. Generate initial implementation.
2. Run hard gates.
3. Run scoring pass.
4. If any gate fails:
   - fix blockers first
   - rerun all gates
5. If score < target:
   - improve the two weakest categories
   - rerun scoring
6. Repeat up to 4 cycles before escalating for user direction.

## 6) Required Output Report

Each build should produce a structured quality report:

```json
{
  "gates_passed": true,
  "failed_gates": [],
  "scores": {
    "core_loop": 4,
    "game_feel": 4,
    "progression": 4,
    "encounters": 3,
    "visual_cohesion": 4,
    "ux": 4
  },
  "total_score": 84,
  "very_good_status": false,
  "signature_moments": [
    "minute_3_mini_boss_intro",
    "final_wave_visual_climax"
  ],
  "next_actions": []
}
```

## 7) Non-Negotiable Anti-Patterns

The following are automatic fail conditions:

1. Default-looking UI with no visual alignment to game style.
2. Flat, unlayered visuals with no hit/death/ability feedback.
3. One-note enemy behavior copy-pasted with only stat changes.
4. Progression that gives numeric changes without playstyle impact.
5. Claiming completion while errors or critical warnings remain.

## 8) Implementation Notes for Godot AI Builder

1. Treat this rubric as a quality gate document, not optional guidance.
2. Integrate checks into phase completion logic.
3. Store quality reports per build (for regression tracking).
4. Prefer failing fast with clear remediation tasks over silent degradation.
